# TruePAN - Reliable PAN Card Verification System

TruePAN is an intelligent document verification system that validates Indian PAN cards using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. 
This application leverages YOLO for object detection, EasyOCR for text extraction, and a deep learning classifier for authenticity checks.

# Features

- Upload PAN card images for verification  
- YOLOv8-based detection of card elements  
- OCR text extraction using EasyOCR  
- Authenticity check using pre-trained ML models  
- Clean result display and user-friendly UI  
- Stores uploaded images securely  
- Invalidates forged or tampered PAN cards
